[.lead]
The Astra Control REST API provides multiple layers of security.

[NOTE]
All HTTP network traffic is protected using the transport layer security (TLS) standard.

== Astra API tokens

To use the Astra Control REST API, you must provide an API token on every request in the `Authorization` request header. Note the following:

* You can generate an API token at the Astra web user interface.
* A token never expires after it is created.
* You can revoke a token at any time at the Astra web user interface.

See link:../get-started/get_api_token.html[Get an API token] for more information.

== Revoking an API access token

You can revoke an API token at the Astra web interface when it is no longer needed.

.Before you begin

You need an account for the Astra service. You should also identify the tokens you want to revoke.

.About this task

After a token is revoked, it is immediately and permanently unusable.

.Steps

. Sign in to Astra using your account credentials.

. Under the *Actions* drop-down box, click *Revoke tokens*.

== Roles and access control
